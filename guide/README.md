# Kaizen Design System Website - www.cultureamp.design

This folder contains the code and content required to build the
[www.cultureamp.design](http://www.cultureamp.design) design system website.

It's built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a static site generator
built with React.

## Contributing

Anyone at Culture Amp can contribute! Open a Pull Request on this repo, and when
we merge it, the new site will be automatically deployed. You're also welcome to
review, approve and merge pull requests.

Tip: you can edit files directly from the Github by opening the file you want
and clicking the "Edit this file" button (the one with a pencil icon). After
you've made your changes it will guide you to open a pull request.

If you need any help, ask somebody in the Front End Capability Team.

### Testing locally

To test locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   `git clone git@github.com:cultureamp/cultureamp-style-guide.git`

2. Run `bin/setup` to install the dependencies

3. Run `bin/gatsby` to start the local development server

4. Visit http://localhost:8000/ to preview the site.

As you edit and save files the site will automatically rebuild and the browser
refresh.

### Changing text content

Most of the text heavy pages, including the product language guide, are created
using Markdown. We actually use a special form of markdown that supports
including React components with JSX, so we use the file extension "mdx".

So if you want to edit text content, find the relevant mdx file and make your
changes.

### Adding icons

If you are adding a new icon, you can add it to the
[_allIcons.js](https://github.com/cultureamp/cultureamp-style-guide/blob/master/guide/src/pages/visuals/icons/_allIcons.js)
file and it will be included on the icons page.

### Adding pages

You can create new pages by creating new mdx or JS files and saving them in the
`pages/` folder. The URL for the page will be based on the folder it is in and
the name of the file. If you would like to set the default page for a folder,
you can call it `index.js` or `index.mdx`.

To add a new page to the main navigation, add an entry to
[_sitemap.js](https://github.com/cultureamp/cultureamp-style-guide/blob/master/guide/src/pages/_sitemap.js)

If you create some helper JS files and don't want them to be treated as pages,
you can start the filename with an an underscore: `_myHelper.js`.

### CSS

The Gatsby site is configured to handle both SASS and PostCSS. If you would like
your file to be treated as a CSS module, it will need to end with the extension
`.module.scss`.
